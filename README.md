# FractalMaker

All of this code was written exlcusively by me on a whim. Thanks to google for inspiration for other curves to try and implement

I had been making fractals like these by just copying, pasting and rotating in microsoft paint and thought it would be cool to have a recursive 
algorithm to draw them faster

The Hilbert Curve is still in development (it doesn't work). May or may not be fixed depending on whether or not I feel like doing it.

The Hexaflake is awesome and I definitely recommend trying it but don't increase the iterations above 9 unless you want to wait 20 minutes
 and maybe crash your computer (I tested it on a crappy laptop. would not recommend).
